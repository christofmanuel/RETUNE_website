    "text": "Reduce tobacco use in people living with HIV in Switzerland: A pragmatic randomized trial within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study\nDue to highly effective antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland have a close-to-normal life expectancy. Among PLWH, there has been a shift of focus from HIV-related health issues to non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancer. Smoking, a prominent risk factor for both diseases, takes a key role in view of the high number of smokers among PLWH.\nNew approaches to smoking cessation focus on harm reduction by substituting tobacco cigarettes by less harmful alternatives. Conventional nicotine replacement therapy like nicotine patches is well established and effective against withdrawal symptoms after quitting. However, these products are exceptionally expensive and the missing “nicotine hit” often limits therapy adherence. The long-term abstinence rate remains low. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and nicotine pouches as alternative nicotine replacement therapies have the potential to overcome these problems and are accessible.\nWith this trial, we also want to address frequent shortcomings of smoking cessation trials, such as restrictive inclusion criteria and highly controlled interventions, offering a menu of different tobacco smoking substitutional products (e-cigarettes or nicotine pouches or nicotine patches).\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "E-Cigarette\n\n\nE-cigarettes, also referred as vapors or electronic nicotine delivery systems, are devices imitating tobacco cigarettes in their use and properties. E-cigarettes heat up nicotine containing liquids to inhale nicotine in the form of vapor in contrast to smoke like in traditional tobacco cigarettes. The liquids are usually available in different flavors and components. By avoiding burning tobacco, e-cigarettes produce a significantly lower amount of harmful chemicals than tobacco cigarettes. Despite potential risks of e-cigarettes, there is widespread agreement that replacing traditional tobacco cigarettes with e-cigarettes can significantly reduce exposure to toxins and carcinogens.\n\n\n\nNicotine Pouches\n\n\nTobacco-free nicotine pouches are nicotine products for oral use. They consist of a small pouch, which is filled with a nicotine-containing matrix. The nicotine comes either from tobacco plants or is produced synthetically. In contrast to the widespread used snus in Scandinavia, nicotine pouches do not contain tobacco. In the application, however, they do not differ, the pouches are clamped between the lip and the palate and provide the nicotine through the oral mucosa. Similarly to e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches are available in different flavor.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
