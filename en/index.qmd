**RETUNE is a pragmatic randomized trial within the Swiss HIV Cohort
Study. The goal of this study is to test different nicotine substitution
products to stop tobacco smoking.**

Tobacco smoking is a major health burden in people living with HIV.
Tobacco smoking is major risk factor for the development of
cardiovascular disease (for example heart attack) and cancer (for
example lung cancer).

RETUNE will test a menu of different nicotine substitution products:

-   E-cigarettes

-   Nicotine pouches

-   Nicotine patches

<p> </p>

The study participants can choose one of the products and receive the
product free of charge for 6 months to quit tobacco smoking.

<p> </p>

The RETUNE study will be conducted at the following hospitals:

-   University Hospital Basel (ongoing)

-   University Hospital Bern (planned)

-   University Hospital Zurich (ongoing)

-   Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen (ongoing)

-   University Hospital Lausanne (planned)

-   University Hospital Geneva (planned)
