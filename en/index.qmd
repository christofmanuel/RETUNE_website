**RETUNE is a pragmatic randomized trial within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The goal of this study is to test different nicotine substitution products to stop tobacco smoking.**

Tobacco smoking is a major health burden in people living with HIV. Tobacco smoking is major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (for example heart attack) and cancer (for example lung cancer).

RETUNE will test a menu of different nicotine substitution products:

-   E-cigarettes

-   Nicotine pouches

-   Nicotine patches

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The study participants can choose one of the products and receive the product free of charge for 6 months to quit tobacco smoking.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The RETUNE study will be conducted at the following hospitals:

-   University Hospital Basel (planned)

-   University Hospital Bern (planned)

-   University Hospital Zurich (planned)

-   Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen (planned)

-   University Hospital Lausanne (planned)

-   University Hospital Geneva (planned)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This study is led by researcher from the University of Basel.
