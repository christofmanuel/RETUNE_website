    "text": "The RETUNE study investigates the effectiveness of a menu of different nicotine substitution products to quit tobacco smoking. The study participants can choose between the following products:\n\n \n\nE-cigarettes\nElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are devices that heat up nicotine containing liquids. The nicotine is then inhaled in form of vapor in contrast to smoke like in traditional tobacco cigarettes. Otherwise, e-cigarettes imitate tobacco cigarettes in their use and application of nicotine. Smoking e-cigarettes is not healthy. But using e-cigarettes can help quitting tobacco smoking and are there under investigation in the study.\n\n \n\nMore information can be found in the Product Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\nNicotine Pouches\nTobacco-free nicotine pouches are nicotine products for oral use. They consist of a small pouch, which is filled with a nicotine-containing matrix. The nicotine comes either from tobacco plants or is produced synthetically. In contrast to the widespread used “snus” in Scandinavia, nicotine pouches do not contain tobacco. In the application, however, they do not differ, the pouches are clamped between the lip and the palate and provide the nicotine through the oral mucosa. Similarly to e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches are not healthy. They have the potential to support quitting tobacco smoking.\n\n \n\nMore information can be found in the Product Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\nNicotine patches\nNicotine-containing transdermal patches are a widely used form of nicotine replacement therapy and an established standard of care against withdrawn symptoms. They are easy to use. They are equally effective for smoking cessation. The transdermal nicotine uptake is slow and nicotine patches need about one hour to reach the maximum nicotine concentration. Afterwards, they create a steady state for up to 24 hours. Therefore, nicotine patches do not imitate the feeling of smoking well. This may limit their effectiveness. However, they are healthier than e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches.\n\n \n\nMore information can be found in the Product Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
